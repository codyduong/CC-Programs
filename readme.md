# My Personal ComputerCraft programs for Minecraft
It should be noted that this uses CC tweaked, and it has been built and tested in FTB Revelations 3.30, so I can't say if it'll work for any other modpacks/older versions of CC which don't support newer APIs/protocols

In terms of understanding/using the code here, they will not work out of the box (usually) so you'll have to have some understanding of directory management in CC, as well as os.loadAPI and multifile programs.

## Syntax Quirks
* _function indicates the use of the function for internal class use only, and while it technically can be called outside after an os.loadAPI call, it is not it's intended purpose
* --params is a holdover from my Java documentation days, it's just a description of the params that a function accepts, as well as a general description of the function precedes it
